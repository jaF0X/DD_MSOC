Containment
- Short term:
    - Can the incident be isolated?
        - If yes, proceed to contained
        - If no, track impact across business areas or other systems to identify scope
    - Are all affected systems isolated?
        - If yes, proceed
        - If no, continue incident investigation for other hosts impacted

- Long term:
    - 

Eradication
 - Can the system(s) be reimaged?
 - Can the system(s) be hardened to prevent future attacks? (patching, compensating controls, etc.)
 - Has the system be cleaned of malicious artifacts?


Recovery -- Not in Rapdev's perview


Lessons Learned
 - Has all documentation been completed?
 - Does the incident report document each phase of the incident repsonse cycle (that Rapdev participated in)?
 - Does the incident report answer the 5 W's for each phase?
 - Has a meeting to discuss Lessons Learned been scheduled?
